Hi, there! I am currently as a Data Scientist Talent at Digital Talent Incubator of Telkom Indonesia. I just finished my undergraduate degree of Informatics at Telkom University with final project called "Real Time Face Expression Recognition System Using the Viola-Jones Method".
This website shows my portofolio projects at Data Science and Statistics. Besides, this portofolio website contains blog page to share my experiences and studies about Data Science and Statistics.
